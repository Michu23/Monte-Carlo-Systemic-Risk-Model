# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Systemic Risk Dashboard is a full-stack web application that transforms the existing Monte Carlo simulation model for systemic risk assessment into an interactive, user-friendly dashboard. The application will provide financial analysts, regulators, and researchers with a powerful tool to visualize, analyze, and compare systemic risk metrics between traditional and blockchain-based banking systems. Users will be able to adjust simulation parameters, view real-time results, and export findings for further analysis.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Backend API

**User Story:** As a financial analyst, I want to access the systemic risk model through a REST API, so that I can integrate it with web-based visualization tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a request to the API THEN the system SHALL execute the Monte Carlo simulation with specified parameters
2. WHEN the simulation completes THEN the system SHALL return structured JSON data with simulation results
3. WHEN a user requests historical simulation results THEN the system SHALL retrieve and return previously saved simulation data
4. WHEN the API receives invalid parameters THEN the system SHALL return appropriate error messages with HTTP 400 status code
5. WHEN the simulation is running THEN the system SHALL provide status updates on the progress

### Requirement 2: Interactive Dashboard

**User Story:** As a risk analyst, I want an interactive dashboard to visualize simulation results, so that I can better understand systemic risk patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display key risk metrics in an organized layout
2. WHEN simulation results are available THEN the system SHALL render interactive charts comparing traditional and blockchain banking systems
3. WHEN a user hovers over data points THEN the system SHALL display detailed information in tooltips
4. WHEN a user selects different chart types THEN the system SHALL update the visualization accordingly
5. WHEN the window size changes THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
6. WHEN data is loading THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading indicators

### Requirement 3: Simulation Parameter Controls

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to adjust simulation parameters through the UI, so that I can test different scenarios and assumptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the parameter controls THEN the system SHALL display current parameter values with appropriate input controls
2. WHEN a user changes parameters THEN the system SHALL validate input values for acceptable ranges
3. WHEN a user submits new parameters THEN the system SHALL execute a new simulation with the updated values
4. WHEN invalid parameters are entered THEN the system SHALL display validation errors
5. WHEN parameters are changed THEN the system SHALL provide an option to reset to default values

### Requirement 4: Bank Data Management

**User Story:** As a financial modeler, I want to view and modify bank data used in simulations, so that I can test scenarios with different banking structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the bank data section THEN the system SHALL display the current bank data in a tabular format
2. WHEN a user edits bank data THEN the system SHALL validate the changes for consistency
3. WHEN valid bank data is submitted THEN the system SHALL update the simulation model accordingly
4. WHEN a user requests to add a new bank THEN the system SHALL provide a form with required fields
5. WHEN a user requests to delete a bank THEN the system SHALL confirm the action before removing the data

### Requirement 5: Results Export and Sharing

**User Story:** As an analyst, I want to export simulation results in various formats, so that I can include them in reports and presentations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests to export results THEN the system SHALL provide options for different formats (CSV, JSON, PDF)
2. WHEN a user selects an export format THEN the system SHALL generate and provide the file for download
3. WHEN a user wants to share results THEN the system SHALL generate a unique URL that can be shared
4. WHEN a shared URL is accessed THEN the system SHALL display the same simulation results
5. WHEN charts are exported THEN the system SHALL generate high-resolution images suitable for publications

### Requirement 6: Authentication and User Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to control access to the dashboard, so that only authorized users can run simulations and view results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to access the application THEN the system SHALL require authentication
2. WHEN a user provides valid credentials THEN the system SHALL grant access appropriate to their role
3. WHEN an administrator creates a new user account THEN the system SHALL send an invitation email
4. WHEN a user's session is inactive for a specified period THEN the system SHALL automatically log them out
5. WHEN a user requests a password reset THEN the system SHALL provide a secure mechanism to do so

### Requirement 7: Simulation History and Comparison

**User Story:** As a risk analyst, I want to save simulation results and compare them with new scenarios, so that I can track how changes in parameters affect outcomes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a simulation completes THEN the system SHALL automatically save the results with a timestamp
2. WHEN a user accesses the history section THEN the system SHALL display a list of previous simulations
3. WHEN a user selects multiple saved simulations THEN the system SHALL provide a side-by-side comparison
4. WHEN comparing simulations THEN the system SHALL highlight significant differences
5. WHEN a user wants to rerun a previous simulation THEN the system SHALL pre-populate parameters from the saved configuration
